# cucumber-typescript-nestjs
Study of the use of cucumber with nestjs and typescript

Examples are on different branches.

List of branches:

- `cucumber-js`: Simple implementation of cucumber with node js in javascript
- `cucumber-nestjs`: Cucumber with nestjs (typescript) without any other library.

    If we change the code so that it is deliberately false, the test remains valid. It is not a good thing.
    
- `cucumber-tsflow`: Using cucumber with decorators in step

    The changes are well taken into account and cause the test to fail normally
